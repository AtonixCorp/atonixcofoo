Attonixcorp Project Plan: Central Server Architecture
Overview: Attonixcorp aims to build a robust and scalable data center to support its business operations and services. This project plan outlines the architecture and components required to achieve a high-performance, secure, and reliable infrastructure.

Architecture Components:

Container Orchestration:
Kubernetes: Primary orchestration tool for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.

Docker Swarm: An alternative orchestration tool for simpler container deployments.

Podman: A daemonless container engine for managing containers and pods.

Operating System:
Ubuntu: Ubuntu is chosen for its stability, security, and extensive community support. It is a preferred choice for server environments due to its robust performance and compatibility with various tools and platforms. Ubuntu will be the foundational operating system for the server and container infrastructure, ensuring a reliable and efficient environment.

Storage Systems:
Ceph: A distributed storage system providing object, block, and file storage in a unified system.

OpenStack: A cloud computing platform for managing large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources.

vSphere: VMware's cloud computing virtualization platform for managing virtualized environments. vSphere will be utilized for its powerful capabilities in virtual machine management, enabling efficient resource allocation and high availability within the data center.

Security:
Cryptography: Ensures data encryption and secure communication.

Access Control: Manages user permissions and access levels.

Firewalls: Protects the network from unauthorized access.

Encryption: Safeguards data at rest and in transit.

CI/CD Pipeline:
Zuul: An open-source CI/CD system for automated testing and deployment.

GitHub: A platform for source code management and version control.

GitLab: An integrated DevOps platform for source control, CI/CD, and project management.

Configuration Management:
Chef: Automates infrastructure configuration, deployment, and management.

Databases:
PostgreSQL: The primary backend database for reliable and scalable data storage.

MySQL: An additional support database for specific applications.

Big Animal: A specialized database for unique data needs.

MangoDB: A high-performance, scalable database solution.

Backend & Frontend Structure:
Backend: Managed by Kubernetes with auto-scaling and load balancing. Services communicate through secure APIs.

Frontend: Hosted separately, interacting with the backend via secure endpoints.

User Management:
Authentication and Authorization: Handled by the security layer to ensure user data privacy and integrity.

User Data: Managed in appropriate databases based on usage and requirements.

High Availability & Redundancy:
Replicas: Implemented for storage and databases to ensure high availability.

Load Balancers: Distribute traffic to avoid single points of failure and enhance performance.

Operator:
Rook Operator: Automates the management of Ceph clusters within Kubernetes, ensuring efficient storage solutions.
